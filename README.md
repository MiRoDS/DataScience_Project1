# DataScience_Project1
1st project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Write a Data Science Blog Post

This is the first project of the Data Science Nanodegree program. In the Jupyter-Notebook file AirBNBAnalysis.ipynb an analysis is performed to mainly find out what influences the review score rating of an accommodation. See the full story on my [blog post](https://mirods.github.io).

1. Installations: There is no installation required. You just need Jupyter-Notebook, e.g. from an Anaconda installation. Make sure that you also have Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

2. Project Motivation: Goal was to find out whethers renters can benefit from the findings if it is possible to influence the review score rating.

3. File Description: There is just one file. Just load AirBNBAnalysis.ipynb into your Jupyter-Notebook.

4. How to Interact with your project: Go through the cells and execute them.

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.: Thanks to Udacity for the very interesting introduction into the Data Science Process.
