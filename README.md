# DataScience_Project1
1st project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Write a Data Science Blog Post

This is the first project of the Data Science Nanodegree program.
In the Jupyter-Notebook file AirBNBAnalysis.ipynb, an analysis is performed to find out what influences the review score rating of an accommodation.
See the full story on my [blog post](https://mirods.github.io).
